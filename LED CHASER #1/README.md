aim:- to make a connection of single led chaser.
apparatus required:- four leds,five wires,audrino uno,connector wire that connects audrino and breadboard,cable.
documentation:-connect negative of the leds to the in the digital pins of audrino and all with the ground wire also.the connections should be made proper and with non deffective harware pieces used.
problems faced:-code not written correct,code is correct i.e,software hardware is correct but cant be ported-port problem,connections went wrong.
observation:-code should be written carefully with taking in my mind the common mistake done in declairing input and output commands also in selecting pi no. in the code suppose we joined pin 13 in audrinoi but in code ae aere writing pin 4.
